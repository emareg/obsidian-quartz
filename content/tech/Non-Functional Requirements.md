A short overview of possible NFRs.

-   **Functional requirements** specify **what** the system should do. E.g. "Display the last user ID that logged into the system."
-   **Non-functional requirements** specify **how** the system should be. E.g. "The system should _be secure_ against code injection attacks." 

NFRs have many different names and can be classified according to different hierarchies/dimensions. According to ISO/IEC 25010:
![[nfrs-iso25010.svg|nfrs-iso25010.svg]]

However, some categories seem very related (compatibility & portability), some popular terms are missing (sustainability, transparancy, safety, privacy) and the overview does not provide definitions. The following list/tree is an attempt to give some concise structure to NFRs but different projects might prefer different structures.  Further NFR overviews can be found on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_system_quality_attributes).

### **🛴 [Efficiency:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficiency)** Consume few resources to produce/operate.

This can be distinguished according to the resource type:

-   🕑 **Time:**
    -   ⏳ Latency: Time to respond to one request.
    -   🚿 Throughput: Maximum amount of processed requests per time interval.
-   ⬜ **Space:**
    -   💾 Storage: How much data is stored?
    -   ✉ Message: How much data is transmitted?
-   ⚡ **Energy:** How much energy is required to produce/operate?
-   💰 **Cost:** How much money is required to produce/operate?

### **⛓ [Reliability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_engineering):** Ensure system remains operational.

-   **🌐 [Availability:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability)** Avoid and mitigate failures to increase "uptime".
    -   🛡 Robustness: Do not crash on unexpected requests.
    -   🪂 Fault Tolerance / Redundancy / Resilience: Recover from failures.
    -   📈 Scalability: Handle increased load and avoid stalling/dropping requests.  
          
-   **🔒 Security:** Avoid and mitigate misuse/tampering.
    -   👁‍🗨 Confidentiality: data should not be revealed to unintended recipients.
    -   ✂ Integrity: data should not be changed during transmission.
    -   🛂 Authenticity: data must originate from the correct entity.

### **🔧 Universality/Flexibility:** How many problems can the system solve?

-   💱 [Interoperability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interoperability)/Compatibility: Ability to interact with other systems.
-   🧳 Portability/Adaptability: Ability to operate in different environments.
-   ♻ [Reuseability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusability): Ability to reuse parts for other systems.
-   📈 Scalability: Ability to scale efficiently with growing input.

### **🚧** [**Maintainability:**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintainability) How easy can a system be repaired/modified?

-   🎲 Determinism / Testability: Ability to reproduce behavior.
-   🔍 Transparency / Verifiability: Ability to analyze behavior.
-   🧩 Modularity: Separation into independent parts to lower complexity.
-   ➕ Extensibility: How easy can the system be extended?
-   📖 Documentation: How well is the system documented?

### 👥 Usability: How easy can the system be used?

-   ▶ Simplicity/Learnability: How intuitive is the system?
-   🌍 Localization: Available and adapted to many languages/locations.
-   ♿ Accessibility

### ⚖️ Compliance (Trustability?):

This section is not well-defined yet. Some of these points might better fit somewhere else.

-   🌱 [Sustainability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability): Minimizing negative impact on the _environment_, _society_ and _economy_
-   🎭 Privacy / GDPR / SSI: Ability to self-manage/protect personal data. Users cannot be identified.
-   👉 Accountability: Ability to trace actions uniquely to each entity/agent.
-   ⛑ Safety: Protect users against harmful conditions or events.
-   📝 Standardization: Rely on well-defined components and processes.

### ✔ Correctness:

> This section might be related to functional requirements.

-   🎯 Accuracy: Response should be close to true value. Related to Precision/Resolution.
-   🔬 Sensitivity: System should detect weak inputs.
-   ⏱ Freshness: Response should be recent.
