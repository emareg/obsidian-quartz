### Thinking about Organize
Possible task lists (not inbox!):
SW Dev: 2approve–2build←2check←2do←2grow←2plan←2sort
PDCA but backwards: 2check–2do–2plan  (It is important to do check tasks first!)

Garden analogy: seeds (grow), tree(project), roots (checks), leafs/fruits (acts) 

* Inbox (2sort): Where everything arrives
* Incubator / Garden (2grow):
	* Seeds / Cell / Egg: Abstract Idea
	* Soon / Receptor: Wait for specific condition
* Planner Tool: Kanban-Board / Worklists (of actionable / checkable): 
	* 🟠Check /Calls/ Pending 2check (need checking) → Or in communication?
	* 🟡Do /Actions/Focus/Active 2do (do soon)
	* 🟣Plan / Grow / Feed / Horizon / Init / Define / Next 2plan (stored) → Or Incubator?
	* (Done) → Not shown
	* 🟢Export / Publish / Finish / Finalize  → Not a task category! (same as done)
	* 🔷Hold / Keep / Maybe / Res / Rest/ Know
* Calendar: For events.
* Communication Tool.
	* Should track where answers are pending. →Use colors? 🔺Important/Problem
* Library / Data: For general resources, ideas, articles
* Projects: For complex topics
	* Ideas: Horizon 
	* Projects: Testing 
	* Version: 


2sort, Act, await/aw8, Due, Horizon,  Got, Res, w84 ("wait for"), Vision


* Default task that is not in inbox is "Action Item"
* Tasks with due date is calendar or start with "Event: "
* Await tasks start with "await" "w84", "Condition"
* Communication tasks are "call"
* References/Resources start with "res"  (not urgent)
* Goals, future, later, plan

# Old CORE Process 2023-08-16
A method for processing documents and information based on [[Getting Things Done (GDT)|GTD]]. CORE stands for:

1. **Capture**: Store any input at a central “inbox”. URLs, ToDos, Notes, Talks, PDFs, Quotes, etc.
2. **Organize**: Go through the inbox and define next step for each item:
	1. **Do it now:** If it is a task that requires less than 2min, execute immediately.
	2. **Delegate:** Forward the item to another person.
	3. **Defer:** Put into the correct list: act, aw8, calendar, later, projects, resources, someday  
3. **Review/Reflect**: 
	* Daily: Get your inbox to zero. Review tasks or Reduce information.
	* Weekly: Update your lists/info. 
4. **Execute**: Express/Export information in own words. Engange/Execute a task.



## Capture: Out of your brain 
Capturing allows you to get something off your mind quickly. When a thought hits your brain, it can (and will) suppress all other thoughts until you do something about it. You should transfer any new input into your **inbox** within few seconds.

> Your brain is made for having ideas... not for storing them.


### Clarify

1. **Do it now:** If it is a task that requires less than 2min, execute immediately.
2. **Delegate:** Forward the item to another person.
3. **Defer:** Put into the correct list: act, aw8, do, due, event, horizon, maybe, idea, later, projects, resources, someday


## Organize
Organize each input by providing context (time, location, topic). Put into the correct list:

1. Action-Items: A list of single-step actions that need to be done.
2. Calendar: For events that will happen at a specific time.
4. Projects: Everything that requires multiple steps is a separate list.
5. Maybe Someday: Not forgetting. Might become relevant in the future.
6. Waiting-on: Everything that depends on external events.
7. References: All materials that could help at some point in time.
