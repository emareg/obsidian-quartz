The hierarchy of waste management:
- **reduce:** Buy only what is needed. Buy less often.
- **reuse:** Buy high quality and reuse items before throwing them in the trash.
- **recycle:** If you trash items, put them in the correct recycling bins.

Further R's:

- **refuse** Actively counteract waste. Unsubscribe paper ads. 
- **repair:** Fix stuff before tossing it.
- **rot:** Compost organic waste.
