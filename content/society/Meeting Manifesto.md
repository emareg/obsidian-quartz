All meetings consume time and money. Many meetings waste time and money. Here are 12 rules for running a meeting efficiently. 

1. **Share Goal & Agenda upfront:** What should be the outcome? What will be discussed? Not answering both questions means the meeting is unnecessary.
2. **Flag people as optional:** Flag most people as optional and let them decide whether the meeting is valuable to them. Allow them to leave early so that they dare to join. Hint: If you can check mails during a meeting, *you* are optional. If everyone can check mails, the meeting is optional.
3. **Be prepared:** You don’t need five people to watch one person look up numbers in a report.
4. **Make notes:** Decisions and Action Items that are not written down and tracked will be forgotten. 
5. **Start on time:** Waiting for latecomers might seem like a nice gesture but is disrespectful towards the people that joined on time. Either truly start 9:00 or schedule for 9:05.
6. **Discuss with ≤5 people:** If you have more than 5 people, your meeting should be a single-person show (presentation/status report), a parallel collaboration (e.g. conceptboard), or a voting. Remember: On TV, you never see discussion rounds with more than 5 people and there are reasons for it.
7. **Discuss at least three ideas.** One idea is bad, two ideas is an argument, three ideas is a discussion.
8. **Have a parking lot for off-topics:** Whenever a discussion starts drifting off, make a note of the idea/concern and deal with it later. Stay focused on the agenda/outcome unless the off-topic is a blocking issue for everyone.
9. **Be clear, not clever:** Avoid technical jargon and use concise and easy words. Not everyone has the same knowledge background, language/pronunciation skills or WiFi stability.
10. **Silence is confirmation.** Do not wait for positive verbal feedback. Ask for concerns and/or collect votes using the [Approval Voting System](https://youtu.be/orybDrUj4vA) (ask for all the OKs).
11. **Practice active listening.** People won’t hear your idea unless you’ve heard theirs.
12. **Don't follow these rules. Follow the principles they reflect.**
